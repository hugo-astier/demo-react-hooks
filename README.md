# Demo React Hooks

List of examples showcasing the new React Hooks, by fetching data from an API using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). For each example, two components:

- The Class component (the previous method)
- The Hook component (the new method)

_Having the two components side by side allows to understand Hooks better._

Each example is joined by descriptive comments in the code explaining the new Hooks syntax.

They include these concepts:

- Declaring, Reading, and Updating the state, with the State Hook: useState
- Performing actions during component's lifecycle, with the Effect Hook: useEffect

## Demo

[Demo available here on Heroku](https://aqueous-river-27979.herokuapp.com/) <br>
(There is a normal small delay the first time loading the app due to "waking-up" the Heroku dyno ([more info here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours#dyno-sleeping)))<br><br>

## Setup

Install dependancies: `npm i`

Run dev server: `npm start`
